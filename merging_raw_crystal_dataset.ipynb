In particular, for each crystal structure (we have 7 different crystal structure), the releated dataset will be loaded from a large-text-file. As output of this script we want a dataframe (X) which collect all the spectrum position (from 0 to 90, increasing by 0.02) and 7 different dataframe (one for each crystal structure), which collect the releated intensity with respect the X position in the spectrum. Moreover, in each Y dataset, we collect also the cell paramenters size, which will be used as target features in future task. Lastly, dataset will be saved."],"metadata":{"id":"B5ECk_f7IIVZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import library"],"metadata":{"id":"wt3u9-XoJf7-"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"svVbGCt0GbiW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1665594229407,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":333,"user":{"displayName":"LEONARDO SACCOTELLI","userId":"18413620544580082956"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]}]}
